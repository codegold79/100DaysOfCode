# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, July 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I forked this repository and made my first entry in this log. I worked on the qryuser.go file, where I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to run SQL queries using the go-sql-driver. After writing half the query I needed to find users, I decided to change direction and work on my first commit where I follow the Hello Service tutorial that @daved wrote for us. I spent more than an hour this first day, but I got my [first PR](https://github.com/OpenEugene/openboard/pull/48/commits/612ba1b87df560e82af7fc49c224f5ff58a9b863) submitted. I also gave some feedback on @mckelveygreg's [PR](https://github.com/OpenEugene/openboard/pull/42#pullrequestreview-268759359).

**Thoughts** Since coming back from #GopherCon 2019, I've been pumped about keep up with my Go studies and projects. When @mckelveygreg challenged me to 100 Days of Code, I readily accepted. What I've wanted to work on lately has been the OpenBoard project. I haven't been making much progress because I've been distracted by Netflix and games on my smart phone. This coding challenge should put me on a more productive track. I'm so glad to have such encouraging friends!

### Day 2: Wednesday, July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got a few more commits in for openboard user service. I'm back at the place I left from yesterday when I was in the middle of the find users query. I wasn't able to proceed any further in the query because I don't know how users are being found. Are we finding them with their email addresses? Their roles? Any of the above? There were a few segways I took from the main code. I installed libsecret on my machine so I can store credentials with git. I also adjusted a keyboard shortcut setting in VS Code so it acts more like Sublime.

**Thoughts** I noticed that Daved had built the go code (maybe with `go build`?), and that go.mod and go.sum were generated, which were in the Hello Service commits. I'll go ahead and run that command after I'm finished writing the queries.
