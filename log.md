# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've finally decided to commit to commits on Github. I logged my first day on FreeCodeCamp on Jan 1, 2018, however, it is long past due of writing it all down.

Day 1: February 21, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Completed a portfolio I can be proud of, successfully got my weather app to change backgrounds by using the weather descriptions and a flickr API, got my tail handed to me on CodeClash, and dove into recursion on KhanAcademy
  (it's winter break :)
  - Thoughts: I struggle with mathy CS principles that are new and  with getting CSS to do what I want. I think I will do CodingGame CodeClash everyday in order to hone my skillz. I'm so happy I got my weather app finished!!

 Day 2: February 22, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Actually finished a CodeClash! a simple if/then counter. Learned about merge sorting with Khan, started the wiki viewer project, spent some time on w3schools.com learning about forms, found movethewebforward.com, starting to dive into jquery with learn.jquery.com, finally decided I should write all this down so I forked 100daysofcode, learning how to use github
  - Thoughts: Khan is killin' me, but it is good to know the upper bounds of my CS limits, apparently w3schools.com sucks and is a scam so need to move on from them, learn.jquery.com looks promising, github is really confusing for the time being. 

 Day 3: February 23, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked through Khan's Quicksort Algorithms, lost a CodingClash about summing powers..., tried to get momentum on the FCC wiki viewer project, read ch. 1 and 2 of Clean Code
  - Thoughts: Khan is still over my head but it feels like good exposure, I need to give the wiki viewer a break till i understand more of what is going on for json/ajax
  
 Day 4: Feb 24, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked through MDN's HTML tuts and finished with their markup assessment.
  - Thoughts: I would like to make it through MDN's tuts, plus it is nice to feel like my practice is paying off...

 Day 5: Feb 25, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Was able to do some work on SoloLearn's CSS tuts on a road trip up from Eugene.
  - Thoughts: Thank goodness for SoloLearn! They have really helped when I've been up a creek without access to my laptop!
 
 Day 6: Feb 26, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Loaded a bunch of plugin's to Visual Studio. Finished MDN's HTML with their Structuring a Page TUT. Also, had to retype the last few days because I forgot to save this log... :/
  - Thoughts: I'm liking working from a real IDE instead of doing everything just through codepen, despite it being so handy. I need to learn how to post my own stuff!

 Day 7: Feb 27, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Made it through MDN's multimedia and embeding tuts, just need to do the assesement.
  - Thoughts: I really hope this is time well spent. I'm getting much more fluent with HTML and the web, but I feel like i'm moving too slow... 
 
 Day 8: Feb 28, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did the MDN HTML multimedia and embeding assesement. Also read some clean code in the morning.
  - Thoughts: Glad I was able to get anything done after today's basketball game vs the students! Also, applied for a Reventure Job in Eugene... had to put my major as Education because Theology wasn't an option...

 Day 9: Mar 1, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did my morning reading of Clean Code: don't leave useless comments, and make a function for everything! 
  - Thoughts: Glad I got a little coding in after music tonight. I'm pooped, I need to learn more, and I hope this all works out.... 
  
 Day 10: Mar 2, 2018
  - Today's Progess: Clean Code - Don't write dumb comments. MDN - advanced tables.zzzz 
  - Thoughts: Wish I had more time to work today... need to finish HTML...
  
 Day 11: Mar 3, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Moved on from HTML to CSS.
  - Thoughts: Tables look like a giant waste of time! There has got to be a better way. The CSS practice seems like a good idea, but really, I'm aiming to be comfortable enough to do the wiki and twitch projects! 
  
 Day 12: Mar 4, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Did a CSS Type Setting tutorial. Concepts: ems, <a> link states, colors, web fonts.
  - Thoughts: My web design is so ugly... I'm a little ashamed...

 Day 13: Mar 5, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Got into code narrative with Clean Code. Started styling CSS Boxes. Tweeted about Hipster Ipsum!
  - Thoughts: It was monday night, and students were over. Not much time to code.. :(
 
 Day 14: Mar 6, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Didn't get much done becaues of Jazz. Review CSS backgrounds
  - Thoughts: I am starting to make a social media splash :)
  
 Day 15: Mar 7, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Finished the MDN CSS Box tuts. Made a cool box and styled some letter head
  - Thoughts: applied for 2 jobs today, got a call back from a call center and hat is sorta funny :) 
  
 Day 16: Mar 8, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Read Ch. 6 in Clean Code: Objects and Data Structures. Also, had "lock-in" at school, so couldn't do anything in the evening. 
  - Thoughts: It is really hard to balance work with learning... Also, I am through 100pgs of Clean Code! 
  
 Day 17: Mar 9, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Watched some FreeCodeCamp videos about computer basics in order to get ready for CompApps class. Also, read ch. 7 in Clean Code: Error Handling.
  - Thoughts: Had to spend my evening sermon prepping, but at least I could read. I will probally have to read the whole book again, but at least I'm getting exposure?
  
 Day 18: Mar 10, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked on the final section for CSS on MDN: CSS Layout.
  - Thoughts: Can't wait to finally be geared up and renewed for javascript and document manipulation so I can finish my wiki-viewer and twitch page. I really want to move on with better JS, but I feel my lack of CSS and HTML understanding has been holding me back.
