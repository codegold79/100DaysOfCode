# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've finally decided to commit to commits on Github. I logged my first day on FreeCodeCamp on Jan 1, 2018, however, it is long past due of writing it all down.

Day 1: February 21, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Completed a portfolio I can be proud of, successfully got my weather app to change backgrounds by using the weather descriptions and a flickr API, got my tail handed to me on CodeClash, and dove into recursion on KhanAcademy
  (it's winter break :)
  - Thoughts: I struggle with mathy CS principles that are new and  with getting CSS to do what I want. I think I will do CodingGame CodeClash everyday in order to hone my skillz. I'm so happy I got my weather app finished!!

 Day 2: February 22, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Actually finished a CodeClash! a simple if/then counter. Learned about merge sorting with Khan, started the wiki viewer project, spent some time on w3schools.com learning about forms, found movethewebforward.com, starting to dive into jquery with learn.jquery.com, finally decided I should write all this down so I forked 100daysofcode, learning how to use github
  - Thoughts: Khan is killin' me, but it is good to know the upper bounds of my CS limits, apparently w3schools.com sucks and is a scam so need to move on from them, learn.jquery.com looks promising, github is really confusing for the time being. 

 Day 3: February 23, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked through Khan's Quicksort Algorithms, lost a CodingClash about summing powers..., tried to get momentum on the FCC wiki viewer project, read ch. 1 and 2 of Clean Code
  - Thoughts: Khan is still over my head but it feels like good exposure, I need to give the wiki viewer a break till i understand more of what is going on for json/ajax
  
 Day 4: Feb 24, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Worked through MDN's HTML tuts and finished with their markup assessment.
  - Thoughts: I would like to make it through MDN's tuts, plus it is nice to feel like my practice is paying off...

 Day 5: Feb 25, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Was able to do some work on SoloLearn's CSS tuts on a road trip up from Eugene.
  - Thoughts: Thank goodness for SoloLearn! They have really helped when I've been up a creek without access to my laptop!
 
 Day 6: Feb 26, 2018
  - Today's Progress: Loaded a bunch of plugin's to Visual Studio. Finished MDN's HTML with their Structuring a Page TUT. Also, had to retype the last few days because I forgot to save this log... :/
  - Thoughts: I'm liking working from a real IDE instead of doing everything just through codepen, despite it being so handy. I need to learn how to post my own stuff!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
